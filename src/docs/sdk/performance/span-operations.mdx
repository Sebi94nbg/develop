title: "Span Operations"
---

Span operations are a short code identifying the type of operation the span is measuring.

Operations are expected to follow [OpenTelemetry's semantic conventions](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/trace/semantic_conventions/README.md) as much as possible.

Below is a table containing a list of span operations that are recommended to be used.

Operations are expected to generally take the form: `CATEGORY.ACTION`, where the categories and actions can have optional identifiers. For example, a redis database operation takes the form `db.redis.set`, where `db` is the category, `redis` is the category identifier, and `set` is the action. Another example is a mobile app rendering it's screen. It would have the operation `ui.load.hot`, where `ui` is the category, `load` is the action, and `hot` is the action identifier.

It's important to keep categories consistent between sdks and integrations as they are used by Sentry in the [Operations Breakdown](https://docs.sentry.io/product/sentry-basics/tracing/event-detail/#operations-breakdown) feature. For example, both `db.init` and `db.query` will be categorized as database operations.

Having both a category and action is recommended. Operations should be lowercased.

# Abhijeet's Notes (WIP)

## List of Actions

### User Interfaces

1. `init` -> initialize the UI
2. `load` -> load stuff in?
    a. `pageload` -> browser specific loading a page
3. `update` -> update something in the ui
    a. `navigation` -> navigate to another screen/page without full restart/refresh


### Web Servers

- `browser.mark` and `browser.measure` operations were previously referred to as `mark` and `measure`. Should we make this change?
