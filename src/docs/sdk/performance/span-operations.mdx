title: "Span Operations"
---

Span operations are a short code identifying the type of operation the span is measuring.

Operations are expected to follow [OpenTelemetry's semantic conventions](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/trace/semantic_conventions/README.md) as much as possible.

Below is a table containing a list of span operations that are recommended to be used.

Operations are expected to generally take the form: `CATEGORY.ACTION`, where the categories and actions can have optional identifiers. For example, a redis database operation takes the form `db.redis.set`, where `db` is the category, `redis` is the category identifier, and `set` is the action. Another example is a mobile app rendering it's screen. It would have the operation `ui.load.hot`, where `ui` is the category, `load` is the action, and `hot` is the action identifier.

Having both a category and action is recommended. Operations should be lowercased.
