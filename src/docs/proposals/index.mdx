title: "Sentry Enhancement Proposals"
---

A Sentry Enhancement Proposal (SEP) is a document describing a new feature or a change for Sentry, typically one that involves changes to multiple components (SDKs, Relay, Snuba, frontend, etc). A SEP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature/change.

The mere existence of a SEP does not mean it was ever nor will ever be implemented.

A SEP formally captures an idea and serves as a basis for further discussion and, if so decided, the implementation of the proposal.

A SEP also serves as a track record that can provide a historical understanding of the design decisions that have gone into a certain feature or change in Sentry.

SEP numbers are assigned by the SEP authors, and once assigned are never changed.
